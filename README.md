For backend, head over to this [repo](https://github.com/prasunka/mess-management-server).


## Run Locally
First, setup the environment for building and running the app. Follow this setup [tutorial](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) for React-Native CLI and Android studio.

After setting up the environment, clone the repository and open the directory in terminal. Run the following commands:
```
> yarn
> npx react-native start
> (in separate shell) npx react-native run-android (or run-ios if you want to run on iOS simulator)
```
